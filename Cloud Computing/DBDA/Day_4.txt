Stateful Communication-
Stateful communication refers to a type of communication between two or more entities (such as computers or applications) in which each entity maintains a record of the current state of the communication. In other words, each entity involved in the communication keeps track of the data and status of the interaction.
One advantage of stateful communication is that it allows for more complex interactions between entities, as the entities can keep track of the current state of the interaction and adjust their behavior accordingly. However, stateful communication can also be more complex to implement and manage, as the entities involved need to maintain a record of the current state of the communication and ensure that they are communicating in a consistent manner.

Stateless communication
Stateless communication is a type of network communication in which the server does not maintain any information about the client's previous interactions or "state." Each request is handled independently, and the server treats each request as a new transaction. This makes it simpler to scale and manage the server, but can result in less efficient communication.
